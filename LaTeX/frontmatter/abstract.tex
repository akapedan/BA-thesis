\initial{T}he present thesis aims to measure the effects of administrative corruption, bureaucratic obstacles and informal sector competition on Albanian firm growth and innovation activities. We used different corruption and firm performance variables collected from the BEEPS data-set of 2019, which yielded a total of 72 regressions. Due to data-related issues and the violation of the model assumptions our findings are weak and should be interpreted carefully. The results reveal that none of the three administrative corruption proxies have a significant effect different from zero on any of the four firm performance variables. Moreover, we found a positive moderating effect of bureaucratic obstacles on the relationship between inspection bribe and firm innovation. Considering informal competition we found that it negatively moderates the relationship between bribe index and employment growth as well as between bribes and innovation activities.
